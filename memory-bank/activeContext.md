#### Comprehensive Applicant Dashboard

- **Files**: `templates/template-applicant-dashboard.php`, `assets/css/applicant-dashboard.css`, `assets/js/applicant-dashboard.js`
- **Major Features Implemented**:
  - **Statistics Cards**: Application counts with status breakdown
  - **In-Place Editing**: Toggle between view and edit modes

- **Data Display**: Professional formatting with fallbacks for empty data

#### Asset Management System

- **Performance Optimization**: Assets only load when needed
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Current Architecture Decisions

#### Template System

- **Decision**: Using `template_include` filter with theme override support
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility while maintaining WordPress standards
- **Implementation**: Plugin templates with `/careernest/` theme override directory
- **Status**: Implemented and working

#### Data Storage Strategy

- **Decision**: WordPress post meta with serialized arrays for complex data
- **Rationale**: Native WordPress approach, no external dependencies
- **Examples**: Education, experience, licenses stored as array structures
- **Benefits**: Integrates with WordPress ecosystem, searchable, extensible

#### Role-Based Access Control

- **Decision**: Three-tier system (AES Admin, Employer Team, Applicant)
- **Current Implementation**: Basic role creation and capability assignment
- **Status**: Implemented in M3, working as designed

### Pending Decisions

#### Job Listing Display Strategy

- **Question**: How to handle job filtering and search functionality?
- **Options**:
  1. WordPress native search with meta queries
  2. Custom AJAX-based filtering system
  3. Hybrid approach with progressive enhancement
- **Recommendation**: Start with WordPress native, enhance with AJAX later

#### Pagination Approach

- **Question**: Standard WordPress pagination vs. AJAX infinite scroll?
- **Current Lean**: Standard WordPress pagination for SEO benefits
- **Consideration**: May add AJAX enhancement later
